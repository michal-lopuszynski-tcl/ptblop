# Pruning transformer blocks in PyTorch

This repository contains tools for pruning transformer blocks in PyTorch:

* [ptblop](./ptblop) - package containing builders for block-pruned transformer models in PyTorch.

* [ptblopgen](./ptblopgen) - (work in progress) package containing algorithms for block pruning transformer models in PyTorch.
